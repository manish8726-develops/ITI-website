      Today is the era of science which is growing fast. Its effect can be seen on development of our Industries. The machines are controlled by electronic method. But all these growth was achieved with help of mechanical machines. For making any type of machine whether it is a computer, Television, Rocket its structure or body, which is the most essential of that unit are made first and then all components are assembled in that body. To manufacture all these components machine such as Lathe, Milling, Shaping, Grinding, Drilling, Welding are required. These machines are operated by skilled operator and parts are made with accuracy. Out of all these operations, same parts require some rectification which is completed by a Fitter with required accuracy.
